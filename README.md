# Audio Classification on AWS

## Background

Audio or acoustic sound is all around us, it can be generated by machinery in a factory,  a living animal, or human with flu like symptoms such as sneeze and cough. When sufficient audio data is collected, it can be put into use with machine learning to do anomaly detection and classification.

## Objective

The objective of this post is to demonstrate audio classification using SageMaker PyTorch framework which can be easily modified to suit different use cases.

## Dataset

* UrbanSound8k

## What will you learn?

- Building acoustic classification model using PyTorch
- Building a custom container on SageMaker PyTorch Deep Learning Framework
- Run PyTorch training job using SageMaker script mode
- Deploy custom model using default SageMaker PyTorch container for inference
